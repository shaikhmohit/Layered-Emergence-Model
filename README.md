## Overview

The **Layered Emergence Model (LEM)** is a generative cosmological framework based on a minimal ontology:  
a creation point from which **space and matter emerge continuously**, combined with local matter dynamics governed by  
**Tension (T)**, **Orientation (O)**, and **Response (R)**.

LEM replaces curvature-based explanations with a **purely generative process** in which:

- space grows outward through continuous emergence  
- matter does not stretch with space  
- rotation at the origin imprints angular motion  
- all dynamics arise from local T–O–R interactions  

From this minimal structure, LEM provides conceptual explanations for:

- expansion without metric curvature  
- redshift through cumulative wavelength stretching  
- vacuum dominance through geometric dilution  
- large-scale isotropy from a single generative origin  
- filament-like structural tendencies from local alignment  
- force-like behaviors emerging from T–O–R dynamics  

LEM is presented as a **conceptual framework**, not a completed physical theory.  
It establishes the generative ontology and qualitative laws on which future mathematical and computational work can build.

## Current Status

LEM is currently in the **conceptual and mathematical development phase**.

The repository includes:

- the full conceptual formulation  
- ontology and axioms  
- generative laws  
- derived consequences  
- observational correspondences  
- open questions  
- future research directions  

A simulation component (Python-based visualization of continuous emergence and T–O–R dynamics) is planned for a future update.

## Goals of the Project

- Establish LEM as a coherent generative cosmological framework  
- Develop mathematical formulations of continuous emergence and T–O–R dynamics  
- Build simulations to explore structural tendencies and vacuum evolution  
- Investigate connections between emergent T–O–R behavior and classical forces  
- Prepare for eventual preprint submission (e.g., arXiv)
