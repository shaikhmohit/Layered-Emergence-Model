## Overview

The **Layered Emergence Model (LEM)** is a generative cosmological framework that replaces curvature-based
gravity and metric expansion with a simple, discrete, and symmetric process of layer creation. Each new
layer expands the universe outward, stretches existing space, and introduces new matter with internal
properties defined by **Tension (T)**, **Orientation (O)**, and **Response (R)**.

LEM provides a unified, minimal ontology capable of producing:

- cosmological expansion without dark energy  
- gravitational-like attraction without curvature  
- early structure formation without dark matter  
- isotropy without inflation  
- redshift without metric expansion  
- emergent force-like behaviors from T–O–R interactions  

This repository contains the current manuscript and supporting documents for the theory.

## Current Status

LEM is currently in the **conceptual and mathematical development phase**.  
The simulation component (PyQt6-based visual model) will be added in a future update.

The current documents represent:

- the full theoretical formulation  
- axioms and laws of LEM  
- observational consequences  
- open questions  
- future research directions

## Goals of the Project

- Establish LEM as a coherent generative cosmological framework  
- Provide a clear alternative to curvature-based cosmology  
- Develop a simulation that visualizes layer creation and T–O–R dynamics  
- Explore emergent classical forces within the T–O–R structure  
- Prepare for eventual preprint submission (e.g., arXiv)
